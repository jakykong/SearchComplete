This is an updated version of the old SearchComplete plugin, which allows movement commands to work with it. 
The file has been renamed so that upload to vimscripts site won't conflict.

I left the variable loaded_search_complete the same so that it won't conflict with existing SearchComplete.
Be aware that both could exist side-by-side since the filename is different.

This version has been uploaded to http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5438

Call me lazy but I wanted to be able to tab-complete words while typing in a search and I have always been up to a challange.  After learning a lot more about vim and key mapping then I ever knew before, this is the result, working tab completion inside a search.
